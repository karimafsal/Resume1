    <p><h3> Voice Pathology Detection System (Main Project)</h3>
       <p> A significant number of people suffer from voice pathology. This
        pathology can be easily cured if detected early. Here, a voice
        pathology detection system within a smart healthcare framework is
        proposed. The inputs are obtained by microphones and
        electroglottography devices to capture voice and EGG signals.
        Spectrograms are obtained from these signals and fed into a trained
        CNN. The features extracted from the CNN are fused and predicts
        output. The proposed system is evaluated using a publicly available
        Saarbrucken voice database.</p>
        <h3> Automated Canteen Ordering System (Mini Project)</h3>
        The main aim of this project is to deliver the food items as fast to
        college students,staffs.This website provides a menu list with different
        categories of food items and is managed by the admin.Users can pay
        online as well as offline mode after ordering.This website eliminates
        the crowd in the canteen.</p>
